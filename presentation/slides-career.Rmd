### - Some are in tech, but not in data 

--

### - Some are students or recent graduates

--

### - Some are neither

# Unconditional advice
--

<br><br>

### - Start a blog (maintain a portfolio)
### - Build, use, and give back to your network
### - Keep learning

---
# Start a blog
--

#### - Practice analyzing data and communicating about it
#### - Create a portfolio of your work and skills
#### - Get feedback and evaluation

http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/

--

> My promise is this: **if you’re early in your career as a data scientist and you start a data-related blog, tweet me a link at @drob and I’ll tweet about your first post** (in fact, the offer’s good for each of your first three posts) *~ David Robinson*

---
# Build, use, and give back to your network
--

#### - Volunteer at user groups, meetups, and yes, SQL Saturdays
#### - Ask to be a speaker
#### - Learn from the best and immediately share that knowledge back
#### - Volunteer your skills
#### - Contribute to open source

--

---
# Keep learning
--

<br><br>

### - MOOCs, online classes and learning platforms
### - Traditional education
### - Immersion

---
# Find your niche in the data science food chain
--

- Teach what you've learned 
    - through blogging
    - through speaking
    - through message boards and Stack Overflow
- Be an aggregator and a connector
- Blog on a specific topic (e.g. politics, basketball, music)
- Contribute to open-source (even if it's correcting typos)
- Be a computer scientist for data scientists.

# Some more specific advice
--

- If you feel you're lacking some formal education - consider going back to school

### What happens if the explanatory and response variables are sorted independently before regression?

> Suppose we have data set (Xi,Yi) with n points. We want to perform a linear regression, but first we sort the Xi values and the Yi values independently of each other, forming data set (Xi,Yj). Is there any meaningful interpretation of the regression on the new data set? Does this have a name?

> I imagine this is a silly question so I apologize, I'm not formally trained in statistics. In my mind this completely destroys our data and the regression is meaningless. But my manager says he gets "better regressions most of the time" when he does this (here "better" means more predictive). I have a feeling he is deceiving himself.

# Some more specific advice

- If you feel you're lacking some formal education - consider going back to school
- If you're a recent graduate, consider internships 

--

- If you're a working professional, see if you can pivot within your organization.
    - business analyst
    - mentor / sponsor
    - cross-training
    - improve your work with data
